# A paper a day for 100 days (7/17-10/25)
This is a challenge I am setting in order to keep up with the latest research. New models and papers are coming out multiple times per day, and I feel like I have been falling behind. This challenge will hopefully keep me motivated to read a paper every single day, or two for a day if I miss one for any reason. By the end I hope to have a deeper understanding of the Machine Learning world and the Academia world, and hope to be able to implement some papers on my own. I will publish a summary of every paper I read here, and it should allow me to stay accountable. The first one is already up!
